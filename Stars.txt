Custom Extra:
- Extreme granularity for PCG. Only using given prefabs - Wall & Floor for level building. Everything you see is generated. No pre-made room prefabs etc. Achieved by generating in order of: Room Connectors, Floors, Walls, Extras, Entities and Pickups. Code available to prove.
- Dynamic enemies with difficulties, types and modifiers each, presenting > 600 variety of enemies.
- Modified the way enemy aggro works. Regardless of distance, if enemy gets shot by Player, it will know where the Player is and chase for a preset amount of time (Default 3f). This makes the enemies less "dumb" and more reactive to the Player's actions, eliminating the "camp and shoot out of range" tactic.
- Calculation of camera zoom and center position in each generation of layout to ensure it will always show the entire map
